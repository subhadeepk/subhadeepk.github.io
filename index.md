# About

I am a senior at [Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/). You will find my resume [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R4gfbGRg_DPmfEXfYtnhAesv7193RAoXcedgzMwPltI/export/pdf).

I've always been interested in robotics and large systems with lots of moving parts. So far, I've taken up every opportunity that have come my way and have worked on a number of diverse research problems. Recently, I've taken a keen interest in Reinforcement Learning and the exciting world of opportunities it has opened up for enhancing robotic control and decision making.

Beyond my passion for robots, I'm a film enthusiast. My fascination with robotics may well be rooted in that pivotal moment when I first experienced the iconic film, Blade Runner (1982). Additionally, I have a deep appreciation for Alt Rock and Hip Hop music, and on lazy Sunday afternoons, you can often find me strumming a Pink Floyd or Guns N' Roses tune on my guitar.

# Professional summary 

With over a year of dedicated research experience in robotics and UAVs, I have demonstrated my expertise in the field. I successfully crafted a ROS framework for a decentralised drone swarm, enabling both leader-follower mode and independent missions. This framework powered the deployment of a swarm of five drones.

As a key contributor to the Swarm Project at SPIN Lab, IIT Kanpur, I engineered essential network monitoring tools and ROS-based congestion control solutions for dynamic mesh networks.

Additionally, my co-authorship on a paper addressing the thermal runaway of Lithium-ion batteries earned the prestigious Best Paper Award at a prominent conference.

Currently, I am leading a talented team of four students in the development of an innovative swash plate-less helicopter.
