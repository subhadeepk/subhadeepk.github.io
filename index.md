Hi!, I'm Subhadeep, a CS PhD student at Lehigh University. I work with Professor David Saldana as a part of the Swarms Lab. You will find my resume [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R4gfbGRg_DPmfEXfYtnhAesv7193RAoXcedgzMwPltI/export/pdf).

# What am I working on?
I have just completed my first year in the PhD, and am trying to find a research direction for myself. I am interested in a couple of problems:
1. Aerial robot navigation in turbulent flows: How can robots collaborate and share information to tackle turbulent air flows and reach their goals.
2. Modelling complex physical interactions using Model-based Reinforcement Learning. 

# A semi-professional summary 

Details regarding my experiences are available in my resume. Here's a brief summary:

- Have 2.5+ years of experience of research in the fields of robotics and UAVs.
- Developed a ROS framework for a decentralized drone swarm that supports leader-follower mode and independent missions, which was used to deploy a swarm of 5 drones at IIT Kanpur
- Developed network monitoring and ROS based congestion control tools for moving mesh networks
- Co-authored a paper on thermal runaway of Lithium-ion batteries that won the best paper award at a conference and a paper on multi-robot pursuit evasion at Conference of Robot Learning (CORL ‘24)
